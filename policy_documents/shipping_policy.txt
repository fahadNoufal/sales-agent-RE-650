ROYAL ENFIELD BULLET 650 - SHIPPING & DELIVERY POLICY

1. VEHICLE DELIVERY (MOTORCYCLES):
- Dealership Pickup: The standard delivery method is "Self-Pickup" from the authorized dealership selected during the booking process.
- Home Delivery: Premium home delivery is available in select metropolitan cities. This service may incur an additional "Flatbed Delivery" fee to ensure the motorcycle arrives in pristine condition.
- Timeline: Delivery timelines depend on the "Waiting Period" at the time of booking. Once the vehicle is invoiced and registration is complete, delivery usually occurs within 24–48 hours.

2. ACCESSORIES & APPAREL SHIPPING:
- Courier Partners: Genuine accessories and riding gear ordered via the online portal are shipped via partner courier services (e.g., BlueDart, Delhivery).
- Shipping Charges: Free shipping is applicable on all accessory orders above ₹1,500. For orders below this, a flat shipping fee of ₹100 applies.
- Tracking: A tracking ID will be sent via SMS/Email once the items leave our central warehouse.

3. INSPECTION UPON DELIVERY (PDI):
- For vehicle deliveries, a Pre-Delivery Inspection (PDI) is conducted. Customers are encouraged to inspect the paint, electricals, and fluid levels before signing the delivery receipt.
- Any transit damage must be reported immediately to the Delivery Executive for a "Zero-Cost" rectification.

4. GEOGRAPHIC LIMITATIONS:
- We ship accessories nationwide. However, motorcycle deliveries are restricted to the state in which the vehicle is registered due to RTO (Regional Transport Office) regulations.

5. DELIVERY DELAYS:
- While we strive for punctuality, delivery dates are estimates. Delays caused by RTO registration backlogs or transport strikes are beyond our control, but customers will be updated weekly.
